# MediGen: AI-Based Contextual Medical Report Generator
This project uses the [NIH Chest X-ray](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data/data) dataset containing X-ray images and associated medical reports. The aim is to build a model that can take a chest X-ray image as input and generate a textual report. This model combines an Image Encoder and a Text Decoder.
